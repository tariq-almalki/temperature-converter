## Introduction

Temperature Calculator is an application built using React for converting between units of Temperature Kelvin, Celsius also named Centigrade, Fahrenheit.

let us talk about each unit of Temperature...

kelvin (K), base unit of thermodynamic temperature measurement in the International System of Units (SI). it's named for the British physicist William Thomson (known as Lord Kelvin). An absolute temperature scale has as its zero point absolute zero (−273.15° on the Celsius temperature scale and −459.67° on the Fahrenheit temperature scale)

Celsius also called Centigrade, scale based on 0° for the freezing point of water and 100° for the boiling point of water. Invented in 1742 by the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius, it is sometimes called the centigrade scale because of the 100-degree interval between the defined points.

Celsius used 0° for the boiling point of water and 100° for the melting point of snow. This was later inverted to put 0° on the cold end and 100° on the hot end, and in that form it gained widespread use.

Fahrenheit temperature scale, scale based on 32° for the freezing point of water and 212° for the boiling point of water, the interval between the two being divided into 180 equal parts. The 18th-century German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit originally took as the zero of his scale the temperature of an equal ice-salt mixture and selected the values of 30° and 90° for the freezing point of water and normal body temperature, respectively; these later were revised to 32° and 96°, but the final scale required an adjustment to 98.6° for the latter value.
